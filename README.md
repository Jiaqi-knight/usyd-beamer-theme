====================

This is an unofficial presentation template for the University of Sydney based off the template on the [Faculty of Education and Social Work](http://sydney.edu.au/education_social_work/doctoral_studies/resources/PP_template.pptx) since that is what I could find. The template works in most orientations while retaining the key aspects of the design.
